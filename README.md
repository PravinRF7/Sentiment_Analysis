# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

## Overview

This project is an implementation of sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. Sentiment analysis has applications in various fields, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or Keras, which includes LSTM layers)
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided Jupyter notebook)
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if required)

## Dataset

This project uses the IMDb movie reviews dataset, which contains a large number of movie reviews along with their sentiment labels (positive or negative). You can download it from [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Project Structure


- `Sentiment_analysis_using_LSTM.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for building and training the LSTM model.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-lstm.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-lstm
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
   ```

3. Download the IMDb dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. Open and run the `Sentiment_analysis_using_LSTM.ipynb` notebook to build and train the LSTM model.

5. Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process to suit your needs.

## Usage

The provided Jupyter notebooks guide you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. You can modify and experiment with the code to adapt it to different datasets or use cases.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Make sure to analyze the model's predictions and consider fine-tuning to achieve better results.
